# SOCIAL_FRAME_1 — ledger (llmapi.ai)

Ceiling $220 on APP_LLMAPI_KEY, read from its credit ($500.0000 at the session's first reading, before any call). One door: llmapi.ai, every call pinned with `X-No-Fallback: true`. The gateway returns no per-call charge on this account: each call is booked at the gateway's listed per-token price for the pinned provider (input and output, reasoning inside output), and the credit read at every spend check is the authority.

Booked **$0.3280** in 62 calls; the last credit read $499.7322 → spent by credit $0.2678 (2026-11-11T04:01:06.421Z).
