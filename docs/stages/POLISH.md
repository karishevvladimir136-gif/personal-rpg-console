# Polish — after the owner's first sandbox play

Cloud session (`docs/CLOUD.md`, environment `rpg-console`), branch `claude/polish` from `origin/claude/integration`.
The owner's notes from the first play are added below by the planner before launch.

## Known before the play

1. **A roll that is never narrated.** After an interactive dice roll the turn pauses; the game master's continuation
   after the roll sometimes holds only tool calls and no text, so the player sees the roll but not what happened.
   Seen on Opus in both blind runs (English and Russian). The continuation after a roll must always narrate the
   outcome; if the model returns no text, ask it once more for the narration only, and never close the turn silently.
2. **Stage V review fixes** — `docs/stages/STAGE_V.md` §7: one stage instead of two stacked pictures, a real frame in
   the review screens, a portrait anchor queued for a named person seen in a frame without one, gender and looks from
   the public text until then, visible traits kept in anchors, action text with the same person labels, no mid-word
   cuts.
3. **Latin shorthand in a Russian campaign.** «HP» and «NPC» appear in four game-master notes of the Russian blind
   run, one of them in a counter receipt («без потери HP»). Anything the player can see follows the campaign
   language; notes use the campaign's own words for these.
4. **Astra breaks the fiction about equipment.** In the Russian combat scene Astra said «по установленному снаряжению у
   Роуэна есть компас, но оружия не указано» inside the narration. Questions about the sheet belong in a short
   out-of-fiction aside or a clarifying question, never in the story voice.
5. **Astra sometimes ends a turn without `finish_turn`** (Stage 4 known limit): tension and refusal hints are lost on
   those turns.

6. **The off-screen consequence never arrived.** In the Russian blind run's travel scene (cheat at dice, then two days
   east) the owner saw no consequence in any of the four variants. Find out per variant where the chain broke: was a
   plan recorded with a due time in the cheat turn, did the travel receipt list it as due, did the game master act on
   it. Fix the break (the loop, the receipt hint or the doctrine) and prove it live on both models.
7. **Russian voice.** The owner finds the app's Russian stiff and calqued, while the same Opus in his chat campaign
   writes living Russian. Likely causes, to confirm with an A/B: the role and the procedure in layer 1 are English and
   mostly about tools; the only Russian prose in the prompt are the three turn-shape examples, written in translated
   style («проскальзывает внутрь, в запах муки»); narration is cut into pieces by mid-text tool calls; the prompt says
   almost nothing about voice; the synthetic Russian fixture was machine-translated. Do: for a Russian campaign, write
   the role's voice part natively in Russian (not translated), from the owner's codex `docs/owner/DM_CODEX_RU.md`
   (the planner adds it); replace the turn-shape examples with natural Russian ones; keep the narration in one breath
   (only a deciding roll or payment may interrupt it; bookkeeping goes after); keep tool schemas in English. Check with
   the Russian blind scenes: current prompt vs the Russian voice layer, both on Opus high, four key turns each, and the
   planner builds a blind A/B page. Record the result in `docs/runs/` (it is a research finding).

## Checks

typecheck, lint, the full suite with `--test-concurrency=2`, build, fake bench, screenshots with the overflow check, a
short live smoke on the changed paths within **$5**. Push `claude/polish` only, never `main`. Report in English.
