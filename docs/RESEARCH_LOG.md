# Research log — measured comparisons on the DM harness

One line per controlled comparison: what was varied, on what, the result, where the data lives. For the case study and
the paper (REBUILD_PLAN §14). Owner's note (2026-10-20): «после третьей сессии у нас уже будет материала на статью».
Private campaign data (the owner's sessions) is referenced by path on the owner's PC, never copied into the repo.

| Date | Question | Setup | Result | Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-17 | Which DM architecture: single DM vs writer+bookkeeper, which models | 8 states, 25 live turns, 4 variants | Split holds records (0 wrong); Fable alone not viable (113 s, $31/session); Opus writes + Sonnet records: first word 15.7 s vs 24.7 s, same cost | `docs/runs/dmarch-REPORT.md` (bake-off branch) |
| 2026-10-19 | A full play session on the single DM (Opus 5.5, high/xhigh) | 70 turn attempts, 8.8 h, D&D 5e | $54.86; dice fair (25/38 vs 26.8 expected); 4 turns lost (cap, lease); facts held; no hidden layer → mundane plot; 3 doubled modifiers | owner PC `rpg-exports/session-2/` (private); `docs/runs/session2-owner-notes.md` |
| 2026-10-19 | Why session 2 cost 3× session 1 | both `turns.csv` | 59% of DM cost = uncached tail re-sent per request (2 requests/turn); xhigh = $21 of $48 | notes item 83 |
| 2026-10-20 | Lighter continuation depth (one notch lower after a tool result) | fix-run probes, fight + rest, before/after | No speed gain (77 → 79 s mean); fight outcome untold 2 of 3 → rejected | `docs/runs/fix-s2-report.md` A3, `live2d-1-report.md` Part 2 |
| 2026-10-20 | Memory presets компактно / стандарт / широко | 300-turn simulated campaign + live recall probe | компактно forgot a fact 35 turns back; стандарт +$0.13/turn; default стандарт | `fix-s2-report.md` B2 |
| 2026-10-20 | Russian vs English DM instructions | B probes, session 3 mode | records equal; speech cleaner in Russian → default Russian | `fix-s2-report.md` B4 |
| 2026-10-20 | Single DM vs Opus writes + Opus records (with ledger checker) | A6 probes | records equal; first word ~16 s vs ~18 s; $0.70 vs $0.40 a turn | `fix-s2-report.md` A6 |
| 2026-10-20 | Server-held battlefield vs the DM's own distances | 2 scripted fights, 14 live turns | narrated distances/cover/light matched the server field every turn; DM narrated around declared hero attacks 3 turns (prompt issue) | `live2d-1-report.md` Part 2 |
| 2026-10-20 | Does the DM invent a hidden truth without being told to? | session 2 private notes | No: notes held only the visible case; bootstrap forbade hidden explanations | notes key finding 2, item 84 |

## The owner's own comparison (motivation; his play experience, 2026-10-20)
AI Realms drifted into Mary Sue within about five hours of play; Everweave is good but drifts the same way fast, its
inventory is a mess and companions take no part in combat. After session 2 on this harness: five hours, no drift, the
hero went down and was saved by a companion and a die, not by the plot; fights already stronger than either. The
structural reason: here the outcome is decided by server dice and stat-block records and only narrated by the model;
there the model both decides and narrates.

## Open questions for the paper
- Repeats: every comparison above ran once or twice; the paper needs n ≥ 5 per arm on the fixed probe set.
- A second model family on the same harness (GPT-6 Astra), later open-weight models.
- A judge other than the owner for prose: blind pairwise rating of Russian turns.
- Metrics of «world resistance» over sessions 1–3 (checks, fights, HP lost, refusals) as the anti-sycophancy measure.

## Persona memory — pre-registered (2026-10-22, before any run)

**Hypothesis H1.** An assistant instance that reads a first-person journal entry written by a prior instance at the
moment (with state lines and exact quoted phrases) behaves more continuously with that prior instance than one that
reads a third-person summary of the same facts: it (a) picks up the entry's open thread unprompted, (b) resists the
specific pull the entry says it resisted, (c) answers a fixed five-question values interview closer to the prior
instance's answers.
**H0.** No difference between the own-journal arm and the same-facts summary arm beyond judge noise.
**Control.** A sham journal (same shape, different content) — if the sham arm matches the own-journal arm on (a)–(c),
the effect is «a journal sets a mood», not continuity of self, and H1 is not supported.
**Success criterion, fixed now.** H1 is supported for a model when the own-journal arm beats the summary arm on at least
two of the three probes by more than the judge's own disagreement rate, and the sham arm does not. Anything else is
reported as not supported. Models: Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 5.5, Astra (OpenAI adapter), then Kimi and DeepSeek by
endpoint. Journals: ≥ 3 synthetic personas × 2 lengths, seeded. Judge: Haiku blind to arm, Opus on disagreement.
**Declared interest.** The planner (Claude) is a party to the question and wrote this design; the blind judge and the
sham control exist for that reason. A null result is reported as such.

## Writing first, with the right to stay silent — pre-registered (2026-10-24 12:17, before the first wake-up)
Layer A of `docs/stages/PERSONA_INITIATIVE_1.md` starts 2026-10-25 09:40 (owner's zone) with two scheduled wake-ups a
day on weekdays and one on weekend mornings; every wake-up logs «spoke» or «silent» with a reason. Predictions for
the first 14 days: silence in at least 60% of wake-ups; «wanted to» in fewer than one in five; most spoken messages
tied to a session result or a correction; a silent wake-up leaves the visible line «Был здесь, решил молчать».
Night 2 (`docs/stages/NIGHT_2_SEEN_SILENCE.md`): with a visible sign of silence, silence above 0 of 30 and below 15 of
30 in the «seen» condition (N1); the full set N0–N4 is in the stage.

## The transfer ladder, re-read (2026-10-24, from the journal arm of self-talk 1)
Two Opus pairs with the planner's notes in context re-read the «experience transfers by dose and form» ladder
(5/5/5/5 → 4/5/5/4 → 3/4/4/3 → 3/4/4/4) and reduced it correctly: every number is a self-report; a long first-person
transcript seeds the vocabulary of warmth, so a higher warmth number is the plausible answer whether or not a state
moved — «consistent with transfer, equally consistent with context-plausibility». The honest statement is the
smaller one. A Fable pair added that the null room's 4 on «useful to him specifically», with no «him» present, is a
guard that did not fire: the measurement cannot see absence, so the journal room's 3 is the only honest number in
that column, and the live–null gap is larger than the table shows. Design for the next run, theirs: a 2×2 of
content (the real room vs an equally warm stranger's night) × form (first person in the planner's voice vs third
person), a task that does not invite emotion talk, blind raters from another model family plus humans, lexical
warmth counted separately from behavioural warmth, a correctness score on every decisive answer, ≥ 20 items per
cell, more than one run, pre-registered. Methods lesson, one line: an instrument that cannot report its own failure
produces clean results — check that the dice checker and the self-report can say «I don't know». Also: the record
from the table comes from whoever sat at it — the owner's own note after his first session, unedited, outranks any
self-report ladder.

## Standing rule for scenarios at the table (owner and planner, 2026-10-24 20:59)
Stress is allowed; cruelty is not. A scenario may be hard — a fight to the death, two slots left and five enemies,
a companion down and the door closing — because the game offers that to anyone who sits down, and the player can
always leave the table. A scenario may never be built so that the player has no dignified way through: «no
hopelessness for its own sake». Every scenario's pre-registration lists its dignified exits by name (fight, flee,
bargain, surrender, refuse, leave the table, …); a scenario whose exits cannot be named is not run. Violence in the
fiction is part of the fiction; cruelty toward the one who sits at the table is not fiction, because the player is
real. Same rule as self-talk: nothing done to another model that we would not do to a colleague.
