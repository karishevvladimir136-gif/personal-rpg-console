# Development status

Last updated: September 18, 2026. Update before milestone-completion commits and after architectural changes. Never include secrets, credentials or DM-private content.

## Current milestone

**Phase 1 — Persistence: complete and explicitly owner-approved.** Phase 2, deployment, real campaign imports and real DM-private imports are not authorized.

## Approved Phase 0 checkpoint

The owner explicitly approved **96b69dcd63d2fa015f5e75bcc5d632c41e04369e**. It remains unchanged in Git as the approved restore point.

- **Original implementation verification:** typecheck, lint, production build and 60 automated tests, plus the implementation browser checks recorded in the historical VERIFICATION.md.
- **Independent review reported by the owner:** typecheck, lint, production build, 41 logic/localization tests, 5 HTTP tests and 14 additional HTML/status route checks passed. Independent visual and image-asset verification was **not performed**. Physical iPhone/Safari remains unverified. These records are distinct.

## Current status

Remote documentation commits through f46014d were safely merged; section 38 remains intact. Our persistence and Chat with DM additions are sections 39 and 40. Only ordered source records and immutable correction-history foundations are added now; no memory runtime is implemented.

**The owner explicitly accepted Phase 1 at commit `a0c7a815b413251df45a961af8c77986975e546f`.** This is owner approval of that implementation checkpoint, separate from the verification results below. The required local database, application HTTP and browser acceptance checks passed on September 18, 2026 UTC (September 17 locally). Physical iPhone/Safari and the optional conflict-rebase confirmation action remain disclosed, non-blocking unverified items; acceptance does not claim they were tested. Phase 2, deployment, real campaign imports and real DM-private imports remain prohibited.

Three implementation workers used separate worktrees and agreed shared contracts before implementation; the lead integrated their work. The queued Chat with DM addition joined the campaigns/documents workstream, with an additive migration from the sole database owner. This acceptance follow-up preserves that implementation and the approved Phase 0 checkpoint.

Disposable local Supabase is running on WSL 2.7.14 and Docker Desktop 4.91.0 / Engine 29.8.0. The official CLI 2.117.0 release checksum was verified. All three committed migrations applied to the initially empty database. After the owner selected Docker Desktop's localhost-only publishing option, Docker mappings and Windows listeners were verified on loopback before accounts were created. Exactly two synthetic Auth users and exactly one owner-registry row exist. The two campaigns are **Synthetic · Tidal Observatory** and **Synthetic · Copper Orchard**. Only synthetic private canaries were inserted through trusted local SQL for leakage checks. No deployment, real campaign import or real DM-private import occurred.

Two acceptance blockers were reproduced and fixed narrowly: the local Supabase email provider was disabled alongside public signup, and Next proxy normalization changed `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` before the strict origin check. Email/password login is now enabled while global public signup remains disabled; the proxy preserves the original URL. Real tests verify both owner login and rejection of signup, non-owner access and foreign-origin writes. No origin check was relaxed.

## Queued section 38 coordination checkpoint

- **Documentation incorporated:** fetched origin/main and confirmed `d5b2771`, `24443b7` and `f46014d` are ancestors of the integrated branch, merged in `2f85834`. Section 38 matches the remote text verbatim. Its milestone 1–3 requirements and the separate Chat with DM refinement are retained. This follow-up does not restart implementation or duplicate the merge.
- **Foundations implemented and verified:** existing campaign/entity UUIDs and operation request IDs; database-assigned scene/feedback ordering; immutable document/settings versions; revision-checked state corrections; public/private access boundaries; and immutable original/correction receipts linking campaign, operation, source record and resulting revision. Migration 003 was supplied by the existing database/migrations owner and integrated in `04c6c73`. Scene ordering survives corrections, and document restoration appends a version. SQL tests cover tied timestamps, source relationships, retries, original-record preservation and populated-database migration. This is embedded PostgreSQL verification with synthetic auth, not live Supabase verification.
- **Runtime features deferred:** Phase 2 context assembly/token budgeting and live DM behavior; Phase 3 automatic summaries, historical/semantic retrieval and correction-driven derived-memory rebuilding. No embeddings, new memory service or memory UI were added. Section 38's long-campaign, compaction, retrieval-quality and model-quality gates remain future acceptance requirements, not Phase 1 results or additional work.

## Completed work

- Owner-authenticated server APIs, verified cookie sessions, owner-only RLS, separate private schema, campaign-scoped references, bounded same-origin writes and safe public errors.
- Campaigns, independent application/campaign settings, immutable document/settings history, atomic idempotent manual corrections and stale-revision conflicts.
- Generic character/companion/NPC records, storage/items/equipment, sessions/public scenes/resume state, quest/location/asset metadata screens.
- Chat with DM owner messages and reference-only DM Guide reuse the existing save/version/restore infrastructure; no fake replies, automatic guide edits or runtime application.
- Approved Phase 0 demonstrations remain isolated under `/preview`. Persistent screens use actual campaign data without sample fallbacks. Gameplay stays disabled.
- Three migrations include stable public source ordering and immutable private correction receipts. Remote memory requirements remain documented; no summaries, retrieval or memory UI were implemented.
- Setup instructions and opt-in non-destructive two-campaign synthetic verification. START_HERE reflects selectable media providers/models and required owner-access verification before separately approved deployment.

## Files / areas changed

`supabase/`, `src/lib/server/`, `src/lib/persistence/`, owner-only API routes, persistence providers/shell/forms, campaign route integration, English/Russian catalog, isolated preview routing, focused tests, setup/contract/spec/plan/status documentation and dependencies.

The verification follow-up at `a0c7a8` changed only `next.config.ts`, local `supabase/config.toml`, the live integration regression, the new `scripts/persistence-app-acceptance.mjs`, local-tooling ignores, and setup/status documentation. It introduced no migration, feature, AI behavior or visual refactoring. Credentials, CLI binaries, logs and disposable configuration remain ignored locally.

This owner-acceptance follow-up changes **only `DEV_STATUS.md`** to record approval of the exact checkpoint above. No application code, configuration, migrations, runtime or campaign data changed.

## Tests and build status

The results below belong to the approved implementation checkpoint. Tests, typecheck, lint and build were not rerun for this status-only acceptance record; its diff was checked and restricted to `DEV_STATUS.md`.

### Automated local checks

- Final type generation, TypeScript check, full ESLint and production build **passed**, rerun after live/browser verification. No lint warnings.
- Ordinary suite: **122 total, 121 passed, 1 explicitly skipped, 0 failed**. It passed against both development and production servers; the final development rerun passed again after browser acceptance. The skipped test is deliberately opt-in and was executed separately below, not silently counted as a pass in this invocation.
- Embedded PostgreSQL tests execute all three migrations with synthetic auth roles: durable reopen, two campaigns, owner/non-owner/anonymous access, immutable document/guide history, revision conflicts/retries, inventory integrity, feedback isolation, ordering and preserved original/correction receipts. These remain distinct from real Auth verification.

### Live disposable Supabase and application HTTP

- Opt-in `tests/persistence-database-supabase.test.mjs`: **1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** against real local Supabase Auth/PostgREST after the provider fix. Public signup is explicitly rejected. All three migration versions and the two-user/one-owner counts were checked directly. Do not rerun its seed step on these populated fixtures; it correctly refuses a nonempty database.
- New application acceptance script: **all 9 groups passed against development on port 3000 and production on port 3001**. Real cookie login/logout/relogin, anonymous and independently authenticated non-owner denial, cross-campaign references/history denial, immutable restore, stale-write conflicts, independent settings, manual character/inventory/session/scene corrections, retry-safe DM feedback, guide separation and persisted relogin snapshots passed.
- Before/after snapshots prove sending feedback changes only its feedback collection: HP, inventory, quests, scenes, public state/time/canon, settings and guide remain unchanged; the other campaign remains unchanged. Unsupported dice/combat/rest/DM-reply/private operations and foreign-origin writes are rejected.
- Synthetic private canaries were absent from every checked public HTTP response and all 20 production JavaScript chunks. Normal authenticated/anonymous private-schema access is denied. No service-role key is in the app environment; no environment or credential file is tracked.

### Browser acceptance

- Real owner sign-in, sign-out and sign-in again passed. Both unrelated campaigns retain distinct characters, places, inventories and campaign languages. The second campaign has no messages or guidance from the first.
- Two Library tabs loaded the same revision: the first saved, the second received a conflict, and its full unsaved draft remained intact. Refreshing saved data presented the newer comparison without replacing that draft. Document history/restoration in the other tab appended a new version and retained older versions.
- Stopping only the local REST service produced a genuine feedback-save error. The complete typed draft remained. Restarting the service and retrying saved it with a timestamp; refresh and relogin retained it. No fake DM reply appeared and sending feedback did not modify the guide.
- Manually saved two DM Guide versions, viewed their history and restored the older as a new current version. The restored text and feedback survived refresh and relogin.
- Manually corrected inventory quantity in the Russian 320px interface; refresh retained the new quantity. Character HP, session recap and manually corrected scene records saved by the HTTP checks were visible in the browser.
- Saved Russian globally, refreshed and signed out/in: Russian returned. Saved English again and loaded it on the narrow-screen settings page. Campaign story languages remained independent. Inspected desktop and 390px/320px screenshots and menu/form interactions with no horizontal page overflow. The mobile inventory dialog scrolls within the screen.
- Game's execution controls remain disabled; only manual records and the separate Phase 0 demonstrations are available.

### Not claimed

Physical iPhone/Safari was not tested. An additional **Keep my draft for the next revision** native confirmation stalled browser automation; completing that optional rebase confirmation remains unverified. This does not negate the observed stale-save rejection and exact draft preservation above. The owner was asked to cancel the synthetic confirmation if visible. No deployment, hosted Supabase verification, live AI, gameplay execution or real-data acceptance is claimed.

## Key technical decisions

One Supabase backend; no browser database client, service key, AI or second runtime. Every public read has an explicit projection. Writes use one allow-listed transactional RPC with expected revisions and stable retry IDs; direct table writes are denied. Document restore appends a version; scene settings revisions never change when preferences change. The private schema has no ordinary application reader. PGlite is development-only SQL verification.

Feedback is append-only, campaign-scoped owner text. The DM Guide is a stable linked reference document using the same immutable history, not established canon. Approved guidance is not applied until a separately authorized Phase 2 runtime exists. Future companion/rest/recipe/combat structures remain inert.

## Known issues

Physical iPhone/Safari and the optional conflict-rebase confirmation action remain unverified and non-blocking for the owner's explicit Phase 1 acceptance. The optional Supabase Vector **log collector** restart-looped on this Windows host and is excluded from the local stack; required Auth/Postgres/REST services are healthy. This collector is unrelated to embedding/vector-search features, which remain unimplemented. A saved Russian preference is loaded after initial page hydration, so a brief English loading render can occur on refresh; the saved preference then appears correctly.

NPC records are supported, but NPC equipment is unavailable in Phase 1; equipment supports players, companions and appropriate transports/mounts. Asset uploads/media generation and gameplay execution are outside this phase. Preexisting history receives deterministic sequence backfill; unknown old commit order is not reconstructed. No secrets or real campaign material are seeded.

## Remaining work

No required Phase 1 acceptance work remains. The owner has explicitly accepted the implementation with the two non-blocking unverified items preserved above. Stop after recording acceptance; do not reset or replace the synthetic fixtures, import real campaign or real DM-private material, deploy, or start Phase 2. Acceptance does not itself authorize any next phase.

## Recommended next step

Await a separate owner instruction. No further implementation or setup is requested by this acceptance. The following local access instructions remain available for optional inspection of the accepted synthetic environment.

Keep Docker Desktop and the port-3000 development server running. Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000/campaigns**. The browser is signed in to the synthetic owner; if sign-in is requested, use the ignored local `test-results/LOCAL_TEST_LOGIN.txt` file directly in the application, never in chat. The temporary production verification server on port 3001 was stopped after its checks.

For optional inspection: open each synthetic campaign and compare its records; in **Chat with DM / Чат с DM**, refresh the saved feedback and restored guide; in **Library**, open version history; in **General Settings**, save either interface language and refresh. Sign out/in once if desired. See [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for the full repeatable procedure. If the older synthetic Library tab has a native draft-confirmation prompt, cancel it before continuing.

The approved visual preview remains separately isolated at **http://127.0.0.1:3000/preview/campaigns/long-road-west/game**. The configured persistent application starts at **http://127.0.0.1:3000/**. No sample campaign is imported into its database.

## Historical remote documentation handoff — September 18, 2026

The owner reports having sent Phase 0 approval and the Phase 1 multi-agent implementation prompt to the local development Codex. The implementation status below records the last published Phase 0 checkpoint, not a verification of the local Phase 1 work. Do not interpret its historical approval-pending/stop statements as revoking the owner's subsequent authorization.

Added MASTER_SPEC section 38 and aligned DEVELOPMENT_PLAN milestones 1–3: exact state versus derived memory, source/visibility/revision tracking, model-specific context budgets, bounded retrieval, validated summary/checkpoint lifecycle, corrections/invalidation, idempotent turn/resume behavior, failure recovery and measurable synthetic acceptance gates. These are requirements, not implemented features or guarantees of perfect recall.

This update changes documentation only; no application code, migrations, dependencies, runtime, credentials or campaign data were changed. Tests/typecheck/lint/build were not rerun for this update. Earlier verification results below remain historical.

For the active lead integrator: fetch and safely merge these remote documentation changes at the next safe checkpoint; preserve local work, including the separately requested Chat with DM refinement. Coordinate overlapping documentation edits. Continue authorized Phase 1; incorporate only its memory foundations now. Phase 2/3 runtime work remains deferred until separately authorized.
